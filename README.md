# Backend JS and Mongoose.

Scope of works is availble [here](https://github.com/SUSE-DOS/se-back-end-js-intro-mongoose-assignment/blob/master/assignment.md).

I was unable to follow along assignment:
1. Unsure how to implement a loop to produce ten students in this context.
2. Unsure how to put students into cohorts. I have referenced the cohort numbers for each student and uncertain if this is correct outcome of requirements.
3. Unable to follow referenced mongoose documentation and commands such as 'bulkSave()' and 'populate' in the context of the assignment.
